# Loan Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and preprocess loan datasets, integrating exchange rate data for currency conversion and preparing the data for further analysis or predictive modeling. The objective is to clean and transform the data to identify key trends and patterns in loan approvals, creditworthiness, and financial risk.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled missing values and standardized the loan data.
  - Replaced inconsistencies using conditional logic and efficient Python methods.
- **Currency Conversion**: 
  - Integrated EUR-USD exchange rate data to convert loan amounts, providing standardized financial metrics for cross-country analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Analyzed loan amounts, verification statuses, and state addresses to identify trends and patterns.
- **Data Export**: 
  - Processed and cleaned data is exported as a CSV file (`Loan-Data-Preprocessed.csv`) for predictive modeling and further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis
- **NumPy**: To handle and manipulate large datasets efficiently.
- **CSV Data Integration**: External datasets, including exchange rate data (EUR-USD), were incorporated for currency normalization.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
